# callmyreps-server

> Server-side components for callmyreps

To run, do `docker-compose up` and visit `http://localhost:3030/`.

In development, the app will automatically reload when you change anything
in the `src/` directory. You should only need to rebuild the docker
container if you have `npm install`ed something.

To install a new dependency:

```sh
npm install --save awesome-module
docker-compose down
docker-compose rm
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
